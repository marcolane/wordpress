## About This Branch

The WordPress Plugin Boilerplate is being rewritten from the ground up and will be officially released in the `master` branch as `3.0.0`.

In order to prevent any interference with the latest stable version, the `develop` branch was created. Once `develop` reaches it's official stable state, it will be merged into `master` as `3.0.0`.

As of **August 19, 2014**, the project is currently in beta.
