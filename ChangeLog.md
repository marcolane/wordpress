## About This Branch

The WordPress Plugin Boilerplate is being rewritten from the ground up and will be officially released in the `master` branch as `3.0.0`.

In order to prevent any interference with the latest stable version, the `develop` branch was created starting with `0.1.0` as per [semver](http://semver.org/).

Once `develop` reaches it's official stable state (that is, `1.0.0`), it will be merged into `master` as `3.0.0`.

## 0.1.0 (18 March 2014)

* Initial commit
